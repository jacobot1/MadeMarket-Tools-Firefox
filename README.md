# MadeMarket Tools

This Firefox browser extension was designed to add helpful features to the investment banking platform MadeMarket. It has the following capabilities:

- Search the Axial private deal-sourcing platform in-site or with the right-click context menu when a search term is highlighted

-  Jump to any page of Firms or Contacts when not in a saved or advanced 
  search (MadeMarket must have extra javascript that runs in addition to 
  the API endpoint request when such a search is activated)

- Auto-format phone numbers pasted from clipboard. It can't access your 
  clipboard, it simply detects when you paste something from it on the 
  MadeMarket site and if it is a phone number, formats it to (xxx) 
  xxx-xxxx.
